PB Tech Redesign

Task 5. Create Infrastructure
In this task, you will setup the infrastructure for your UX Designer's application to run.  Your application and database will reside inside of Docker containers, and you can choose amongst Docker Compose, Kubernetes, and/or Minikube to host and run the containers.  The quickest way is to follow a tutorial that will teach you to setup a hello world (or any) application with this infrastructure.

The target architecture of the infrastructure you are going to setup will be as follows:

Task 6. Update the Application
Once you created the infrastructure with a running application, you need update the code in the container.  In this task, you are asked to insert a document in MongoDB, and update the code at the front end to access the document.

The application at the front end will need to display the "hello world" text by accessing the message field of the MongoDB document.

The following resources may help:

Task 7. Provide feasibility input when needed
Provide input as a developer to your team’s UX Designer(s), with a focus on the technical feasibility of the UX Design prototype you have been given to work with.  Note that your input is provided for advisory purposes only, for it is the UX Designer(s)’ responsibility to make the final decisions on the design.  

Task 8. Attend prototype design walk through
By the end of Week 1, attend the prototype design “walk through” that has been organised by your team’s UX Designers, and ask any necessary questions.  Next week you will build part of the prototype into an application.

Week 2

Task 9. Create Version 1 of the designed application
Create an application based on the version of prototype design you received from UX Designers at the end of Week 1.  You can ask questions to clarify the design with UX Designer(s) as needed, but you do not need to incorporate any design changes made by your UX Designers in Week 2. 

Each developer will work on least ONE screen of the application that has both frontend and backend functionality. You are encouraged to work on more screens if time permits.

Your application will need to use a MongoDB backend, and be deployed using Docker Compose, Kubernetes, or Minikube.  You are encouraged to re-use the architecture in Week 1 by editing the code of the hello world application.

Collaborate using Github to discuss how to share common components amongst developers.
