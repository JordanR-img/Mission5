Mission5
Tasks for Software Developers


Congrats! You’ve made it to the next step in the recruitment process, which means that the recruiting company has asked you to complete a coding challenge - it’s time to show it what you can do. In this Mission, you are going to setup a hello world application to run in Docker in Week 1, and then in Week 2 build part of the application designed by UX Designer, speeding up your deployment of the application using Docker.
Week 1

Task 5. Create Infrastructure In this task, you will setup the infrastructure for your UX Designer's application to run. Your application and database will reside inside of Docker containers, and you can choose amongst Docker Compose, Kubernetes, and/or Minikube to host and run the containers. The quickest way is to follow a tutorial that will teach you to setup a hello world (or any) application with this infrastructure.
Task 6. Update the Application Once you created the infrastructure with a running application, you need update the code in the container. In this task, you are asked to insert a document in MongoDB, and update the code at the front end to access the document.
Task 7. Provide feasibility input when needed Provide input as a developer to your team’s UX Designer(s), with a focus on the technical feasibility of the UX Design prototype you have been given to work with. Note that your input is provided for advisory purposes only, for it is the UX Designer(s)’ responsibility to make the final decisions on the design.
Task 8. Attend prototype design walk through By the end of Week 1, attend the prototype design “walk through” that has been organised by your team’s UX Designers, and ask any necessary questions. Next week you will build part of the prototype into an application.

Week 2

Task 9. Create Version 1 of the designed application Create an application based on the version of prototype design you received from UX Designers at the end of Week 1. You can ask questions to clarify the design with UX Designer(s) as needed, but you do not need to incorporate any design changes made by your UX Designers in Week 2.
Your application will need to use a MongoDB backend, and be deployed using Docker Compose, Kubernetes, or Minikube. You are encouraged to re-use the architecture in Week 1 by editing the code of the hello world application.
Task 10. Present at Show and Tell
At the Show and Tell in Week 7, your team will jointly present both the Generic and Specialist Tasks it has completed.  This presentation should be designed to take around 5 minutes for each team member – so, if you are in a 4-people team you have up 20 minutes in total.  The time limit will be strictly enforced.  You are encouraged to demonstrate your live application.  You can also add PowerPoint slides, Sway or Prezi to help with your presentation.
Task 11. Submit your work By the beginning of Week 7 Show and Tell, upload all of your work (screenshots, presentation slides, documents or other files) using the form below.
