PB Tech Redesign

Create Infrastructure In this task, you will setup the infrastructure for your UX Designer's application to run. Your application and database will reside inside of Docker containers, and you can choose amongst Docker Compose, Kubernetes, and/or Minikube to host and run the containers.

Update the Application Once you created the infrastructure with a running application, you need update the code in the container. In this task, you are asked to insert a document in MongoDB, and update the code at the front end to access the document.

Provide feasibility input when needed Provide input as a developer to your team’s UX Designer(s), with a focus on the technical feasibility of the UX Design prototype you have been given to work with. Note that your input is provided for advisory purposes only, for it is the UX Designer(s)’ responsibility to make the final decisions on the design.

Attend prototype design walk through By the end of Week 1, attend the prototype design “walk through” that has been organised by your team’s UX Designers, and ask any necessary questions. Next week you will build part of the prototype into an application.

Create Version 1 of the designed application Create an application based on the version of prototype design you received from UX Designers at the end of Week 1. You can ask questions to clarify the design with UX Designer(s) as needed, but you do not need to incorporate any design changes made by your UX Designers in Week 2. Your application will need to use a MongoDB backend, and be deployed using Docker Compose, Kubernetes, or Minikube.
